          uniform area on a cortical surface

        * add tfs option to cortical_thickness script (tfs = symmetric
          tnear as in FreeSurfer)
        * fix bug in sub subdivide_mesh in scripts extract_white_surface,
          expand_from_white and marching_cubes
        * crop white matter mask to speed up surface extraction
        * optimize sphere_mesh for speed (from 17min down to 3min or less)

New in Release 3.0.1
--------------------
        * gray-white gradient for white surface calibration
        * improved adapt_object_mesh.c to better account for surface curvature

        * new marching-cubes algorithm and tools for white surface extraction
        * upgraded scripts for surfaces based on new constraints
        * cortical_thickness now uses depth_potential for blurring
        * clean-up some erroneous self-intersection cases

New in Release 2.4.2
--------------------
        * optimized schedule for hi-res white and gray surface
          extraction
        * new white_model_320.obj, made narrower for single hemisphere
        * Note: this is a temporary version until version 3.0 (not in CVS)

New in Release 2.4.1
--------------------
        * use depth_potential in cortical_thickness for smoothing
        * Note: this is a temporary version until version 3.0 (not in CVS)

New in Release 2.3.2
--------------------
	* allow a filename with a dot (".") in it (extract_white_surface.in)
	* fixed a bug in cortical_thickness for tlaplace 
          (correct transformation of volume to native space)
	* create check_self_intersect to verify if a surface self-intersects

New in Release 2.3.1
--------------------
        * extension of cortical_thickness script to compute
          thickness in native space
        * account for voxel size in make_asp_grid
        * some code minor cleanup to favour optimazations by
          64-bit compiler
