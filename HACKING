		Hacking Notes
		-------------

The CVS tag "rel_1" corresponds to the software as David MacDonald had left it
with only a very few minor bug fixes, and autoconfiscation.

The CVS tag "rel_2" is a *branch* tag.  It has a few more fixes, but
none of the new Laplacian stuff (yet).  This is the branch on which
ASP version 1.0 (tag "asp-1_0") was made.

Version 1.x shall be reserved for stable fixes to David's original
algorithm.

Version 2.x shall be reserved for the Laplacian-based modifications by
June.
